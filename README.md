# SeaLevel

Based on sea level data for the last decades, construct a probabilistic model of sea level change.

## Course of research
1.	Find and read the data for the study.
2.	Build a probability model.
3.	Examine the significance of the model parameters and eliminate the insignificant ones.
4.	Examine the adequacy of the model by statistical test and/or stochastic modeling, cross-validation.
5.	Based on this study, correct the model and then check the adequacy of the corrected model.
